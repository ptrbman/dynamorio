About DynamoRIO

DynamoRIO is a runtime code manipulation system that supports code
transformations on any part of a program, while it executes. DynamoRIO
exports an interface for building dynamic tools for a wide variety of uses:
program analysis and understanding, profiling, instrumentation,
optimization, translation, etc. Unlike many dynamic tool systems, DynamoRIO
is not limited to insertion of callouts/trampolines and allows arbitrary
modifications to application instructions via a powerful IA-32/AMD64
instruction manipulation library. DynamoRIO provides efficient,
transparent, and comprehensive manipulation of unmodified applications
running on stock operating systems (Windows or Linux) and commodity IA-32
and AMD64 hardware.

************************************************************
Quickstart instructions for running DynamoRIO:

--------------------------------------------------
On Linux:

32-bit:
  % bin32/drdeploy -client samples/bin32/libbbsize.so 0x1 "" ls
64-bit:
  % bin64/drdeploy -client samples/bin64/libbbsize.so 0x1 "" ls
For additional options:
  % bin32/drdeploy

--------------------------------------------------
On Windows, with examples run from a cygwin shell:

First, set parameters for the target application:
32-bit:
  % bin32/drdeploy.exe -32 -reg calc.exe -root `cygpath -wa .` -client `cygpath -wa ./samples/bin32/bbsize.dll` 0x1 ""
64-bit:
  % bin32/drdeploy.exe -64 -reg calc.exe -root `cygpath -wa .` -client `cygpath -wa ./samples/bin64/bbsize.dll` 0x1 ""

Second, run the application, either natively:
  % cmd /c start calc
Or using direct injection:
32-bit:
  % bin32/drinject.exe `cygpath -wa $SYSTEMROOT/system32/calc.exe`
64-bit:
  Cygwin is 32-bit and the WOW64 redirection prevents it from accessing the
  64-bit system32 directory.  Copy calc.exe using Explorer or the cmd shell
  to ./calc64.exe, and then:
  % bin64/drinject.exe `cygpath -wa ./calc64.exe`

Now close calc and a messagebox should pop up produced by the bbsize client.
