# Data read by "codec.py" and used to generate "codec_gen.h" and "opcode.h".
# After changing this file, run "codec.py" in this directory.

# Columns are:
# - "fixed"    : bits that are fixed for this encoding
# - "variable" : operand bits handled by encoder/decoder functions
# - "opcode"   : mnemonic
# - "type"     : name (suffix) of encoder/decoder functions
#
# Constraints:
# - Variable bits are zero in "fixed": (fixed & variable) == 0
# - No overlaps: ((fixed_1 ^ fixed_2) & ~variable_1 & ~variable_2) != 0
# - Consistent variable bits: type_1 != type_2 || variable_1 == variable_2
