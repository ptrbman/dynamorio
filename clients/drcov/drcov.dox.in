\page page_drcov Code Coverage Tool

\p drcov is a DynamoRIO client tool that collects code coverage information.
 - \ref sec_drcov
 - \ref sec_drcov2lcov

\section sec_drcov The Code Coverage Client

The DynamoRIO tool \p drcov collects information about which basic blocks
have been executed.  It writes the results to a separate log file per process.

The runtime options for this tool include:
 - \b -dump_text:
    Dumps the log file in text format.
 - \b -dump_binary:
    On by default, dumps the log file in binary format.
 - \b -\[no_\]nudge_kills:
    Windows only. On by default.
    Uses nudge to notify the process for termination
    so that the exit event will be called.
 - \b -logdir dir:
    Sets log directory, which by default is ".".

\section sec_drcov2lcov Post-Processing

A post-processing tool \p drcov2lcov is provided to convert binary log files
generated by the drcov client to the lcov format.
The resulting files can be processed by
<a href="http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php">lcov</a>.

Here is an example of post-processing a single log file:

\code
tools/bin64/drcov2lcov -input drcov.myapp.30239.0000.proc.log
\endcode

When post-processing a log file created on another machine, use the \p
-pathmap option:

\code
tools/bin32/drcov2lcov -input drcov.myapp.30239.0000.proc.log -pathmap /data/local/tmp/ /home/derek/android/
\endcode

The command line options for \p drcov2lcov are as follows:
